What does this project do?
This project is intended to help smaller real estate businesses who find it harder to keep up with the price changes of the current housing market.

I was inspired to create a project that addresses the current state of the housing market because due to inflation, prices of properties have been increasing at an unpredictable rate. This hurts people who are forced to pay extra for housing without knowing what the true market price is as well as smaller real estate businesses who don't have the technological means and funding to track pricing and insights. 
I designed a machine learning model using logistic regression and a dataset of housing information that can predict whether a house would be listed above or below its median price.

This application uses a neural network to predict whether a property of the user inputted features would be listed above or below the average median price. 

Smaller real estate agencies can use this technology to assess the market accurately, identify investment opportunities, and make informed pricing decisions when listing properties for sale.
This predictive tool empowers small real estate agencies and property investors with the ability to make data-driven decisions when buying, selling, or investing in properties. 
By leveraging this model, businesses can:
- Identify undervalued properties for potential investment 

- Pinpoint opportunities for profitable sales

- Streamline decision-making processes

- Reduce risks associated with property investments

- Enhance customer satisfaction by offering more precise property valuation estimates

- Strengthen client relationships

- Maximize returns on investments
